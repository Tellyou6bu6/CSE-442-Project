# CSE-442-Project

We are going to create a polling and voting website for teachers to gather students' opinions or ask questions in class, and teachers can record attendance by students scanning QR code or typing in attendance code. Another feature will be notification, teachers can upload any important dates on the website, when the date is coming up, students will get an email from the website.
